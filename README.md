# Lab Notes

There is not a day that we do not take notes, we always need to write down an address, telephone number, notes from a meeting or save our favorite URLs to be able to consult them later. Many times for this activity we use notebooks or agendas that end up being forgotten, or we write scattered in such a way that we lose sight of the priority and purpose of the note, which results in a lost note.
Lab Notes is an application to take notes in a personal way, this app allows us to create, edit, delete, consult them at any time and mark them as reminders, the latter being displayed in the 'reminders' view to locate them more expeditiously.
